# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing provides on-demand resources like storage, networking, compute power, RAM, and CPU from a shared resource pool via the internet.

## üñ•Ô∏è Traditional Physical Server Setup

Setting up physical servers involves:

1. Purchasing hardware components such as CPU, RAM, storage, and networking equipment.
2. Post-usage, the hardware may become underutilized or obsolete.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Models in Cloud Computing

### 1. Public Cloud

- Accessible by multiple organizations and individual users.
- Open for everyone.
- **Example:** [AWS Public Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/)

### 2. Private Cloud

- Dedicated infrastructure exclusively for one organization.
- Not shared with others; maintenance is the organization's responsibility.
- **Example:** [AWS Outposts](https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/) ‚Äî suitable for sectors like banking that require sensitive data handling.

### 3. Hybrid Cloud

- Combines on-premises data centers with public cloud services.
- Enables communication between private and public infrastructures via VPN or Direct Connect.
- **Note:** Hybrid setups can be:
  - Public to Public
  - Data Center to Public
  - Public to Private

### 4. Community Cloud

- Shared infrastructure among a specific group of organizations.
- Used within the community for shared goals.
- **Example:** NTT Data Center

## üõ†Ô∏è Service Models in Cloud Computing

1. **Software as a Service (SaaS)**
   Every thing will be provided by cloud provider, you just need to use application. Starting from Servers,Storage,Network,Virtualization,OS,Middleware,Runtime,Data,Applications
   **Example:** AWS LightSail, Gmail(google provides gmail application)
2. **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**
   Cloud Provider will give us platform to run our applications.
   **Example:**
   AWS Beanstalk: It provides you the platform to run your application. example you want to create a website which is 
   (Server -> OS -> Install word press -> server creation -> public ip assign ->) upload code -> expose to outside world
3. **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**
   Provides Instances
   **Example:** Elastic compute capacity(EC2)

## üñ•Ô∏è AWS Global Infrastructure
1. **Region**
   Geographical location or Physical location
2. **Availability Zone**
   AZ is a data center or multiple DTs. This where our actual resources runs(Instance/Storage/Network)
3. **Edge Location/Point of Presence(PoP)**
   When ever we have some static data which you want to access by users frequently with low latency then we will use edge location.
   When user first time request comes to edge location(EL) then EL will forward the request to AZ and gives response to EL and EL will store response in its cache. Now another user requests the same now it is available in cache it can give the response faster with very low latency.
